                <h2>Here lies the many accounts I've killed...</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been on the internet since I was very young. <br>
                    It's a different place now, you don't need me to tell you that.<br>
                    In fact, chances are, if you're seeing this right now, you probably <br>
                    have a better understanding of internet safety than I do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The need to cull the amount of accounts I have online <br>
                    obviously has a fair bit to do with privacy and the <br>
                    number of databreaches in which I've been alerted that <br>
                    my data has been leaked. <br>
                    But funnily enough, it is mainly due to the fact that I'm <br>
                    losing track of my emails.<br>
                    I joined a local volunteer group and I realised recently that I<br>
                    have missed every meeting they've held - because they communicate <br>
                    by email and I've been conditioned to an extent to ignore anything <br>
                    that comes into my inbox.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think spam has become such a normal part of life on the internet <br>
                    that it takes an active effort to even notice it. I only really noticed <br>
                    this year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because I've practically grown up on the internet, I initially struggled with <br>
                    the idea of eradicating my online presence. I didn't have home videos to look back <br>
                    on to learn about my childhood. I had Instagram. <br>
                    I want to be able to document my accounts here and even share some advice on<br>
                    removing your accounts online for others looking to do the same. They certaintly<br>
                    don't make it easy but it's important to protect yourself in a space where your <br>
                    every move is recorded and used to build an advertisement profile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stay safe out there.

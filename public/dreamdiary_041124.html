                    <h3>4th of November, 2024</h3>
                    <p>
                        It was very very early in the morning, I was aware I could be taken by aliens. I looked to the sky and
                        thought really hard about it but changed my mind and kept walking. If I followed the road, I'd make it.
                        There was a lake / swamp type place. It was beautiful, kind of like a diorama. It was like it was 2D.
                        I had my fish there, a container for each type of fish, containers way too small to be kind to  them.
                        I had three and each had three to five fish that fluttered around. I moved them restlessly, between their
                        containers to bowls to other containers but knew they had to return eventually. <br>
                        I felt a pang of guilt as I slid them back into place, like books on the sole shelf above what appeared to be
                        a park bench. <br>
                        When I returned, there was a woman and a child sitting at a piano bench pressed up against the facade of the trees.
                        I was irritated, I wanted to play the piano but only if I could do so alone. I walked to the other end, looking at the water, 
                        dipping my hand in. It was cold and cleaner than any water I had ever felt before. I walked back to the piano but
                        this time only a woman was stood next to the piano. Feel free, she gestured to me and I sat, attempting to play.
                        It was all wrong, half of the keys were too sticky to move. She wasn't bothered, resting her embow on the lid. I laughed 
                        awkwardly and noted the trouble I was having but the piano kept playing, even once my hands were removed. It confidently 
                        depressed its own keys without any regard for melody. We left it to play, walking back to the road. She complained of 
                        her mother, the woman I saw before. She wanted to teach her how to sing but the woman told me she wanted to sing her own way. 
                        She warbled and cooed in demonstration. It wasn't a pleasant sound to hear but it portrayed a thousand emotions with its 
                        inflection. When I looked around, I realised we were sitting high up in a truck of some sort, she was driving as she spoke
                        and sang. She was taking me home.
